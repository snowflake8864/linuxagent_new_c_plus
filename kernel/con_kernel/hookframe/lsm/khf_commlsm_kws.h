/**
 * struct kws_lsm_list_options - QAXKWS Mdule hook function list
 *
 * * @ptrace_access_check:
 *	Check permission before allowing the current process to trace the
 *	@child process.
 *	Security modules may also want to perform a process tracing check
 *	during an execve in the set_security or apply_creds hooks of
 *	tracing check during an execve in the bprm_set_creds hook of
 *	binprm_security_ops if the process is being traced and its security
 *	attributes would be changed by the execve.
 *	@child contains the task_struct structure for the target process.
 *	@mode contains the PTRACE_MODE flags indicating the form of access.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @ptrace_traceme:
 *	Check that the @parent process has sufficient permission to trace the
 *	current process before allowing the current process to present itself
 *	to the @parent process for tracing.
 *	@parent contains the task_struct structure for debugger process.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.

 *	the current process.
 *	@new contains the new credentials structure for target process.
 *	@old contains the current credentials structure for target process.
 *	@effective contains the effective capability set.
 *	@inheritable contains the inheritable capability set.

 *	Check permission before accessing the kernel message ring or changing
 *	logging to the console.
 *	See the syslog(2) manual page for an explanation of the @type values.
 *	@type contains the type of action.
 *	@from_file indicates the context of action (if it came from /proc).
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.

 *
 * Security hooks for filesystem operations.
 *
 * @sb_mount:
 *	Check permission before an object specified by @dev_name is mounted on
 *	the mount point named by @nd.  For an ordinary mount, @dev_name
 *	identifies a device if the file system type requires a device.  For a
 *	remount (@flags & MS_REMOUNT), @dev_name is irrelevant.  For a
 *	loopback/bind mount (@flags & MS_BIND), @dev_name identifies the
 *	pathname of the object being mounted.

 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @inode_mknod:
 *	Check permissions when creating a special file (or a socket or a fifo
 *	file created via the mknod system call).  Note that if mknod operation

 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @wfile_close:
 *  write regular file close notify. no need return val
 *	@filename contains the closing write-file-full path
 *	@kst	struct kstat for filename
 * @inode_permission:
 *	Check permission before accessing an inode.  This hook is called by the
 *	existing Linux permission function, so a security module can use it to
 *	provide additional checking for existing Linux permission checks.
 *	Notice that this hook is called when a file is opened (as well as many
 *	other operations), whereas the file_security_ops permission hook is

 *
 * Security hooks for file operations
 *
 * * @file_permission:
 *	Check file permissions before accessing an open file.  This hook is
 *	called by various operations that read or write files.  A security
 *	module can use this hook to perform additional checking on these
 *	operations, e.g.  to revalidate permissions on use to support privilege
 *	bracketing or policy changes.  Notice that this hook is used when the
 *	actual read/write operations are performed, whereas the
 *	inode_security_ops hook is called when a file is opened (as well as
 *	many other operations).
 *	Caveat:  Although this hook can be used to revalidate permissions for
 *	various system call operations that read or write files, it does not
 *	address the revalidation of permissions for memory-mapped files.
 *	Security modules must handle this separately if they need such
 *	revalidation.
 *	@file contains the file structure being accessed.
 *	@mask contains the requested permissions.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @file_ioctl:
 *	@file contains the file structure.
 *	@cmd contains the operation to perform.
 *	@arg contains the operational arguments.
 *	Check permission for an ioctl operation on @file.  Note that @arg
 *	sometimes represents a user space pointer; in other cases, it may be a
 *	simple integer value.  When @arg represents a user space pointer, it
 *	should never be used by the security module.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @mmap_file:
 *	Check permissions for a mmap operation.  The @file may be NULL, e.g.
 *	if mapping anonymous memory.
 *	@file contains the file structure for file to map (may be NULL).
 *	@reqprot contains the protection requested by the application.
 *	@prot contains the protection that will be applied by the kernel.
 *	@flags contains the operational flags.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @file_lock:
 *	Check permission before performing file locking operations.
 *	Note: this hook mediates both flock and fcntl style locks.
 *	@file contains the file structure.
 *	@cmd contains the posix-translated lock operation to perform
 *	(e.g. F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK).
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @file_fcntl:
 *	Check permission before allowing the file operation specified by @cmd
 *	from being performed on the file @file.  Note that @arg sometimes
 *	represents a user space pointer; in other cases, it may be a simple
 *	integer value.  When @arg represents a user space pointer, it should
 *	never be used by the security module.
 *	@file contains the file structure.
 *	@cmd contains the operation to be performed.
 *	@arg contains the operational arguments.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @file_open:
 *	Save open-time permission checking state for later use upon
 *	file_permission, and recheck access if anything has changed
 *	since inode_permission.
 *
 * Security hooks for task operations.
 *
 * @task_alloc:
 *	@task task being allocated.
 *	@clone_flags contains the flags indicating what should be shared.
 *	Handle allocation of task-related resources.
 *	Returns a zero on success, negative values on failure.
 * @task_free:
 *	@task task about to be freed.
 *	Handle release of task-related resources. (Note that this can be called
 *	from interrupt context.)
 * @task_kill:
 *	Check permission before sending signal @sig to @ptarget.  @info can be NULL,
 *	the constant 1, or a pointer to a siginfo structure.  If @info is 1 or
 *	SI_FROMKERNEL(info) is true, then the signal should be viewed as coming
 *	from the kernel and should typically be permitted.
 *	SIGIO signals are handled separately by the send_sigiotask hook in
 *	file_security_ops.
 *	@ptarget contains the task_struct for process.
 *	@info contains the signal information.
 *	@sig contains the signal value.
 *	@cred contains the cred of the process where the signal originated, or
 *	NULL if the current task is the originator.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 *
 *
 * Security hooks for Unix domain networking.
 *
 * @unix_stream_connect:
 *	Check permissions before establishing a Unix domain stream connection
 *	between @sock and @other.
 *	@sock contains the sock structure.
 *	@other contains the peer sock structure.
 *	@newsk contains the new sock structure.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @unix_may_send:
 *	Check permissions before connecting or sending datagrams from @sock to
 *	@other.
 *	@sock contains the socket structure.
 *	@other contains the peer socket structure.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 *
 * The @unix_stream_connect and @unix_may_send hooks were necessary because
 * Linux provides an alternative to the conventional file name space for Unix
 * domain sockets.  Whereas binding and connecting to sockets in the file name
 * space is mediated by the typical file permissions (and caught by the mknod
 * and permission hooks in inode_security_ops), binding and connecting to
 * sockets in the abstract name space is completely unmediated.  Sufficient
 * control of Unix domain sockets in the abstract name space isn't possible
 * using only the socket layer hooks, since we need to know the actual target
 * socket, which is not looked up until we are inside the af_unix code.
 *
 * Security hooks for socket operations.
 *
 * @socket_create:
 *	Check permissions prior to creating a new socket.
 *	@family contains the requested protocol family.
 *	@type contains the requested communications type.
 *	@protocol contains the requested protocol.
 *	@kern set to 1 if a kernel socket.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @socket_bind:
 *	Check permission before socket protocol layer bind operation is
 *	performed and the socket @sock is bound to the address specified in the
 *	@address parameter.
 *	@sock contains the socket structure.
 *	@address contains the address to bind to.
 *	@addrlen contains the length of address.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @socket_connect:
 *	Check permission before socket protocol layer connect operation
 *	attempts to connect socket @sock to a remote address, @address.
 *	@sock contains the socket structure.
 *	@address contains the address of remote endpoint.
 *	@addrlen contains the length of address.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @socket_listen:
 *	Check permission before socket protocol layer listen operation.
 *	@sock contains the socket structure.
 *	@backlog contains the maximum length for the pending connection queue.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @socket_accept:
 *	Check permission before accepting a new connection.  Note that the new
 *	socket, @newsock, has been created and some information copied to it,
 *	but the accept operation has not actually been performed.
 *	@sock contains the listening socket structure.
 *	@newsock contains the newly created server socket for connection.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @socket_sendmsg:
 *	Check permission before transmitting a message to another socket.
 *	@sock contains the socket structure.
 *	@msg contains the message to be transmitted.
 *	@size contains the size of message.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @socket_recvmsg:
 *	Check permission before receiving a message from a socket.
 *	@sock contains the socket structure.
 *	@msg contains the message structure.
 *	@size contains the size of message structure.
 *	@flags contains the operational flags.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @socket_shutdown:
 *	Checks permission before all or part of a connection on the socket
 *	@sock is shut down.
 *	@sock contains the socket structure.
 *	@how contains the flag indicating how future sends and receives
 *	are handled.
 *	Return 0 if permission is granted.
 * @inet_conn_request:
 *	Sets the openreq's sid to socket's sid with MLS portion taken
 *	from peer sid.
 * @inet_conn_established:
 *	Sets the connection's peersid to the secmark on skb.
